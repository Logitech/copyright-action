# ðŸš€ Copyright Action

Github Action for automatically inserting copyright notice to the configured directories in a repository and creates a pull request for the same.

Additionally, if the copyright notice is already present in a file/files in configured directories, the action is skipped without modifying the file content. Also, for the empty files, its skipped. And if wrong directory is specified and no files are found matching, according to the given parameters in any of the specified directories, warning message is displayed in the logs.

## Usage

Basic:
```yaml
steps:
  # Checking out the repository which is to be actioned
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  # Implementing action on repository
  - uses: VinnyBabuManjaly/copyright-action@master
    with:
      CopyrightString: 'Copyright check\nAll rights reserved (c)\n'
      FileType: '.py, .txt'
      Path: 'testfolder1/, testfolder2'
      IgnorePath: 'testfolder1/a/, testfolder3'
  # Creates pull request with all changes in file
  - name: Create Pull Request
    uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v2
    with:
      token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
